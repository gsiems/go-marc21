# codegen

The intent is to use the information contained in the LoC field list pages
located at:

    * http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdlist.html
    * http://www.loc.gov/marc/holdings/echdlist.html
    * http://www.loc.gov/marc/authority/ecadlist.html
    * http://www.loc.gov/marc/classification/eccdlist.html
    * http://www.loc.gov/marc/community/eccilist.html

(and saved locally) to extract the information needed to autogenerate
the necessary structures and functions for parsing/linting MARC record
data.
